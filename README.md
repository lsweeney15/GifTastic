# Homework Assignment #6:
### GifTastic

This repository is for homework assignment #6 for University of Miami Coding Bootcamp. 

This game was built using the following: HTML, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery and was made functional by calling upon the Giphy API.

## It's hosted online here: https://lsweeney15.github.io/GifTastic/index.html.

## How it Works:
1. The user will access a screen with hardcoded buttons along the top.

2. When a button is clicked, 10 Gifs from the Gify API will populate along with their rating.

3. The user is then able to pause/play the gif by clicking on the image. 

4. The user may add their favorite movie by entering it into the form and clicking Submit. 

5. Upon clicking, a button will dynamically appear and the user's input value will be read by the Giphy API resulting in 10 more Gifs related to their input.
